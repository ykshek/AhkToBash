## AhkToBash
This is a program to convert Guild Wars 2 Music Autohotkey scripts (numpad and sleep only!) to bash scripts that use `ydotool` for key input

## Why is it in Java?
I have a java exam tomorrow as of writing this.

## Usage

either run with `java -jar 'ahktobash-jar-with-dependencies.jar'`
or install as flatpak with `flatpak install --user com.github.ykshek.AhkToBash.flatpak`

output is stored in `~/output` (yes I know I should be using xdg standards but oh well)
